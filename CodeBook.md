This file describes the variables, the data and work that I performed to clean up the data.

testX: We read the "X_test.txt" and give it to variable "testX".
trainX: We read the "X_train.txt" and give it to variable "trainX".
names: We read the "features.txt" and give it to variable "names".
mergedX: We combine testX and trainX and give it to variable "mergedX". mergedX is 10299 rows by 561 columns.
We then name the mergedX by names.
newMergedX: We select the columns whose names contained "mean()" and "std()" in mergedX. newMergedX is 10299 rows by 79 columns.
subjectX: We read the "subject_test.txt" and give it to variable subjectX.
subjectY: We read the "subject_train.txt" and give it to variable subjectY.
mergedSubject: We combine subjectX and subjectY and give it to variable mergedSubject. It is 10299 rows by 1 column.
testY: We read the "Y_test.txt" and give it to variable "testY".
trainY: We read the "Y_train.txt" and give it to variable "trainY".
mergedY: We combine testY and trainY and give it to variable "mergedY".
We then use the for loop to replace the numbers in mergedY with descriptive activity names.
We then name the mergedSubject column by "subject".
We then name the mergedY column by "activities".
merge: We merged "mergedSubject", "mergedY" and "newMergedX" and give it to variable "merge".
activities: We create a matrix that contains "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING".
means2: We create a 79 by 180 matrix with zeros.
The for loops compute the means of each variable for each subject and each activity.
subjectsandactivities: This variable in the for loop is a 180 rows by 2 columns matrix. The first column contains subject information and the second column contains the activity information.
means3: It transposes "means2". "means3" is now a 180 rows by 79 columns matrix.
tidy: We combine the "subjectandactivities" and "means3". Now the "tidy" variable is a 180 rows by 81 columns matrix.
We then give the column names of "merge" to the variable "tidy".
In the end, we create the "tidydata.txt" file by write.table() function.
